# Iris Flower Species Prediction

This project builds and deploys a **Logistic Regression** model to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. It includes both a console-based prediction script and an interactive web application built with **Streamlit**.

---

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers with four features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The goal is to classify the flower species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) accurately.

---

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using `scikit-learn` and `pandas`.
- Logistic Regression model training and evaluation.
- Console interface for custom predictions.
- Interactive Streamlit web app with sliders for input and real-time predictions.
- Confusion matrix visualization to understand model performance.
- Model accuracy display on test data.

## How to Use

### Console Version

Run the script to enter flower measurements manually and receive a species prediction.

```bash
python iris_predictor.py


## Streamlit Web App

## Run the interactive app locally:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

## Insights

    The Logistic Regression model achieves ~97% accuracy.

    Minor confusion occurs mainly between Versicolor and Virginica species.

    Interactive app allows users to explore how measurements influence predictions.

    Visual confusion matrix helps interpret the classifierâ€™s errors.

## Future Improvements

    Add more sophisticated classifiers for performance comparison.

    Use cross-validation for stronger model validation.

    Expand dataset and features for better generalization.

    Enhance UI/UX with additional visuals and deployment to the cloud.
